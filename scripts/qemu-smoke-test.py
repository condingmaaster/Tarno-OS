"""Boot the built Tarno OS ISO in QEMU and check it actually reaches a
working desktop - an automated stand-in for the manual real-hardware
testing this project has relied on so far.

Why this exists: several real bugs this project shipped (dhcpcd vs.
live-boot's network reset, seatd/video-group crashing labwc back to a
shell, /tmp permissions) only ever surfaced on a real laptop - "a VM
test never hit this" is a recurring line in this repo's own README.
That's not because VMs can't reproduce them; it's because nothing was
actually driving a VM boot to completion and inspecting the result.
This script does that for real:

  - A real virtual GPU (`-vga std`, not `-nographic`/`-vga none`) so
    DRM/KMS, seatd, and labwc get exercised exactly like they would on
    real hardware - `-display none` just means QEMU itself doesn't pop
    a window, the guest still sees a real graphics device it has to
    drive.
  - A *separate* serial console (ttyS0, autologin, see
    0200-agetty-console.chroot) this script drives directly - reachable
    regardless of whatever labwc/seatd are doing on the "real"
    tty1/monitor console, so a crash there is something this script can
    observe and report on instead of something that silently blanks
    the (non-existent, `-display none`) screen.
  - Real assertions against the same things this project has always
    manually grepped for by hand on real hardware: /tmp/tarno-desktop.log
    content, `rc-status`, group membership, and whether labwc/waybar
    are actually still running - not just "did QEMU exit 0".

Usage: qemu-smoke-test.py <path-to-iso>
Exit code 0 = desktop came up clean. Nonzero = a real assertion failed
(printed to stderr) or QEMU/pexpect itself errored out.
