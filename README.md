# THOS — Tarno Hybrid OS

**THOS is a clean-slate operating-system kernel, written in Rust, that runs native
ELF/POSIX programs and native PE/Win32 programs side by side** — no Linux fork, no
Wine process in the tree, no virtualization. One codebase, one machine, both worlds.

> **Status: pre-alpha, single developer.** The executive core and the POSIX
> personality boot and run real unmodified Linux binaries today; the NT personality
> loads and runs real PE executables and on-disk DLLs. There is no graphics stack yet
> and no release. See [Current status](#current-status) for exactly what works.
>
> This repo also contains the **frozen** previous project — a Devuan-based Linux
> distribution — kept for history under a `<details>` block at the bottom and
> [`FROZEN.md`](FROZEN.md).

## Why

Running Windows software and Linux software on the same machine today means a
dual-boot, a VM, or a translation layer bolted onto a foreign kernel. THOS asks what a
kernel looks like if **both ABIs are first-class from the start** and everything below
them is designed fresh for one known set of hardware.

The compatibility contracts are fixed and non-negotiable — they *are* the product:

- **PE** (`MZ`) executables, the Microsoft x64 calling convention, the Win32/NT API surface
- **ELF** executables, the System V AMD64 ABI, the Linux syscall ABI (a growing subset)

Everything under those contracts — kernel, scheduler, memory manager, object model,
IPC, driver model, boot path — is written from scratch.

## The idea in one paragraph

A POSIX `futex`, an NT dispatcher object (`KEVENT`), and a Win32 `HANDLE` to an event
are **three views of one executive object**. Waiting, signalling and reference counting
are implemented once, in the executive core. POSIX signal delivery and NT APC delivery
share one asynchronous-delivery mechanism. A process picks its personality from its
image header (`ELF` → POSIX, `MZ`/`PE` → NT) and keeps it for life; cross-personality
work happens only through shared executive objects (files, pipes, sockets, shared
memory, events), never by one personality calling the other's syscall table. That is
what makes THOS structurally hybrid rather than an emulator: **neither personality is a
guest of the other.**

```

- **Kernel & drivers:** Rust nightly (`x86_64-unknown-none`, `#![no_std]`), toolchain
  pinned in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml).
- **Written fresh:** executive core, object model, scheduler, both personalities, the
  `ntdll` lower boundary, VMM, VFS, HAL, AHCI/xHCI drivers, boot path.
- **Vendored / to be ported (isolated under `third_party/`):** Limine (boot), later
  ACPICA, Mesa/RADV, Wine PE-built DLLs, possibly `amdgpu` KMS.

## Current status

What actually runs today (`cargo xtask` + QEMU/OVMF, verified in CI and the
`*-test` suite):

**Boot & executive core**
- UEFI + Limine → long mode, GOP framebuffer, serial; ingests the Limine memory map.
- Physical frame allocator + bootstrap heap; THOS's own page tables (HHDM + W^X kernel).
- GDT/TSS with IST stacks, IDT, trap handlers.
- **SMP**: all CPUs up (24 on the target; 4 in the QEMU tests), per-CPU run queues.
- Preemptive kernel-thread scheduler, P/E-core classes from `CPUID.1AH`.
- One executive object + handle manager; one wait/sync primitive; APIC-timer subsystem.

**Storage & filesystems**
- **AHCI/SATA** driver with NCQ (queue depth 32), MSI-X completion IRQs, error recovery;
  concurrent-I/O stress-tested.
- **ext2** read **and** write (create/unlink files + dirs, backup superblocks re-synced;
  images pass `e2fsck`).
- **FAT16/FAT32** read; **GPT** parse → find the EFI System Partition.

**POSIX personality**
- ELF64 loader; Linux syscall dispatch (`syscall`/`sysretq` fast path).
- `fork` / `execve` / `wait4`, per-process CWD, real blocking waits (no yield-spin).
- **Unmodified static Linux binaries run as-is**: a static-musl Rust program, and stock
  static **BusyBox** as the login shell with applet symlinks (`ls`, `cat`, …).
- Pipes (`|`) and command substitution (`$(…)`) through BusyBox `sh`.

**NT personality (in progress)**
- Hardened **PE32+ loader**: every input treated as hostile, malformed PEs rejected
  without a panic; base relocations; import resolution.
- Two **synthetic system modules** built in-kernel — `kernel32.dll` and `ntdll.dll` —
  each a one-page PE image with a real export directory of syscall trampolines, threaded
  into the PEB `Ldr` lists.
- **NT syscall dispatch** split into a Win32 layer (`kernel32`: BOOL / `LastError` /
  fd-as-HANDLE) and a native `Nt*` layer (`ntdll`: NTSTATUS / `IO_STATUS_BLOCK`), sharing
  one set of cores.
- PEB/TEB with a real per-thread `%gs` base, `RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS`, `PEB->Ldr`.
- Implemented so far: `GetStdHandle`, `WriteFile`/`ReadFile`, `CreateFileA`,
  `CloseHandle`, `Get`/`SetLastError`, `GetCommandLineA`, `GetModuleHandleA`,
  `GetProcAddress`, `LoadLibraryA`, `VirtualAlloc`/`Free`/`Protect`,
  `GetProcessHeap`/`HeapAlloc`/`HeapFree`, `ExitProcess`; `NtClose`, `NtWriteFile`,
  `NtReadFile`, `NtAllocateVirtualMemory`, `NtTerminateProcess`,
  `LdrGetProcedureAddress`, `LdrLoadDll`.
- **Real on-disk DLL loading from `C:\Windows\System32`**: a per-load `Loader` stages
  each dependency into a VA arena (parse → relocate → parse exports → recurse into its
  imports → map) and binds the IAT to real export addresses. Import cycles terminate.
- A hand-built PE `.exe` runs to exit doing raw syscalls, Win32 file I/O, memory
  allocation, `GetProcAddress`/`LoadLibraryA`, a 9-argument `NtWriteFile`, and a call
  into a real on-disk `thoscrt.dll` (which itself imports `kernel32!GetLastError`).

**Not yet**: `DllMain`, Wine-sourced DLLs, a registry, SEH, WOW64 (32-bit PE),
any GPU driver / real graphics (GOP framebuffer only), NTFS, the security subsystem.

## Build & run

Needs a Linux host with: the pinned Rust nightly (rustup reads
`rust-toolchain.toml` automatically), `qemu-system-x86_64`, OVMF firmware
(`/usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE.fd`), and the build tools `as`, `ld`, `mke2fs`,
`debugfs` (e2fsprogs), plus `sfdisk`, `mkfs.vfat`, `mtools` for the FAT test.

```sh
make toolchain                 # rustup target + rust-src + llvm-tools
git submodule update --init     # third_party/limine (pinned binary release)
make -C third_party/limine      # build the limine host tool

make run                        # build kernel + ISO, boot in QEMU, serial on stdout
make run-gui                    # same, with a QEMU display window
```

`cargo xtask <cmd>` is the entry point for everything (`make` targets just wrap it):

```sh
cargo xtask build               # build the kernel ELF
cargo xtask iso                 # build target/thos.iso (BIOS + UEFI bootable)
cargo xtask run [--gui]         # build ISO + boot in QEMU
```

## Test suite

Each test builds the kernel with a feature flag, boots it headless in QEMU with a
prepared disk image, and asserts on the serial log. Serial is streamed live to your
terminal, prefixed per run.

| Command | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `cargo xtask smp-test` | scheduler + wait primitive across all CPUs, tens of thousands of context switches clean |
| `cargo xtask ahci-test` | AHCI identify + LBA read, out-of-range rejection |
| `cargo xtask ncq-error-test` | NCQ error path + device recovery |
| `cargo xtask ext2-test` | ext2 read/write; the image then passes host `e2fsck` |
| `cargo xtask fat-test` | GPT → ESP → FAT32, reads `/EFI/THOS/HELLO.TXT` |
| `cargo xtask busybox-test` | stock static BusyBox runs unmodified |
| `cargo xtask pipe-test` | `|` and `$(…)` through BusyBox `sh` |
| `cargo xtask pe-test` | PE loader: relocations, imports, TEB/PEB, Win32 file I/O + memory, `GetProcAddress`, the `ntdll` boundary, and a real DLL from `C:\Windows\System32` |
| `cargo xtask kbd-test` / `login-test` | USB-HID keyboard + first-run login (interactive build) |
| `cargo xtask bootpick-test` | the multi-boot OS picker enumerates disks and chainloads |

CI runs the boot test in [`.github/workflows/qemu-boot.yml`](.github/workflows/qemu-boot.yml).

cost/risk in [`docs/thos/feasibility.md`](docs/thos/feasibility.md).

| Phase | Scope | State |

| 2 | VFS, AHCI, ext2/FAT/GPT, **POSIX personality**, shell | done (install-to-SSD deferred) |
| 3 | **NT personality** at userspace level: PE loader, `ntdll` boundary, Wine DLLs, registry, SEH, WOW64 | in progress |
| 4 | **Real graphics** — the GPU driver for Navi 23 (the hard one) | not started |
| 5 | Hardening + a real app; the security / antivirus subsystem | not started |
| 6 | Research track: loading real `.sys` drivers (NDIS proof of concept) | not started |
| 7 | Hardware breadth beyond the one target machine | last |

## The "download it and it runs" goal — and its limits

The compatibility layers are meant to be a **first-class part of the OS**, not
something the user installs or configures. The loader inspects the binary and picks the
runtime itself — ELF → Linux personality, PE → NT personality + Wine-sourced DLLs,
Steam/Direct3D title → Proton profile (Wine + DXVK/vkd3d), `.apk` → an Android profile
on the Linux personality. The model is Rosetta on macOS: invisible.

**"Download → runs, zero setup" is the target for** native Linux binaries, Win32 apps,
and **games without kernel anti-cheat** (the bulk of Steam), plus EAC/BattlEye titles
where the developer enabled the vendor's Proton mode.

**It is *not* achievable for kernel anti-cheat / device-attestation titles**
(Vanguard, ACE/NTE, recent Ricochet, EA Javelin, …). Those decide, server-side,
whether an environment is genuine; THOS will not forge attestation. See the
[anti-cheat / attestation section in `feasibility.md`](docs/thos/feasibility.md) for
the full analysis and the honest boundary.

## Target hardware

THOS targets **exactly one machine**, which is what keeps the driver surface finite:

| Part | Value |
|---|---|
| Board | ASRock B760M-HDV/M.2 D4 (AMI UEFI) |
| CPU | Intel Core i7-13700KF — 8 P-cores + 8 E-cores, 24 threads, no iGPU |
| GPU | AMD Radeon RX 6600 (Navi 23, RDNA2) — behind an on-card PCIe switch |
| Boot disk | SATA SSD (THOS boots from SATA, not the NVMe) |

Full inventory and driver implications: [`docs/thos/hw-target.md`](docs/thos/hw-target.md).

## Licensing

THOS is **GPL-2.0-or-later** — the whole repository, including the frozen Devuan
components (full text: [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and [`LICENSES/`](LICENSES/)). It was
AGPL-3.0 until 2026-08-29; GPL-2.0 was chosen so that GPL-2.0-only code such as the
Linux `amdgpu` driver can be combined later. Exceptions: vendored code under
`third_party/` keeps its upstream licence, and the console font is the Terminus Font
under the SIL OFL 1.1. Every source file carries an `SPDX-License-Identifier`; files
that cannot are mapped in [`.reuse/dep5`](.reuse/dep5). Rationale, the compatibility
matrix and the `amdgpu` question: [`docs/thos/licensing.md`](docs/thos/licensing.md).

## Contributing & legal boundaries

Early days, single developer — issues and discussion welcome. If you contribute code,
the project keeps a hard **clean-room** rule so it stays distributable:

- **No Microsoft binaries or their disassembly** as a reference for THOS code — not
  `ntdll.dll`, not `.sys` drivers, not "just to study how it works". Reading the
  disassembly and then implementing the equivalent produces a derivative work.
- **No leaked proprietary source** (Windows, or anything else), ever.
- Reimplement Windows behaviour **only** from: clean-room projects (**Wine**,
  **ReactOS** — LGPL/GPL, built for reuse), public documentation (Microsoft Learn, the
  WDK headers, *Windows Internals*), and black-box observation of **programs** (not OS
  internals).

This is the same rule Wine and ReactOS enforce, for the same reason.

## Frozen: the Devuan distribution

<details><summary>Previous Tarno OS — a Devuan-based Linux distro. Frozen, kept in the repo.</summary>

A Devuan-based Linux distro with OpenRC instead of systemd, and `tarnod`
(this repo's Go daemon) doing gaming-mode tuning, eBPF security, and a
Mistral-backed assistant.

## Build the live ISO

On a Devuan machine:

    make devuan-iso

Wraps `scripts/build-devuan-live.sh` - installs `live-build` and runs
`lb build` against `tarno-devuan-live/`. Native debootstrap already knows
Devuan suite names, so unlike CI this needs no package swap.

## Test it

    make devuan-run

Boots the built ISO in QEMU (needs `qemu-system-x86_64`). For real
hardware, write it to a USB stick with `tarno-install`:

    go build -o tarno-install ./cmd/tarno-install
    sudo ./tarno-install tarno-devuan-live/*.iso sdX

or install it to an internal disk from a running live session with
`tarno-disk-install` - now actually shipped in the image (`sudo
tarno-disk-install` lists internal disks, `sudo tarno-disk-install sda`
installs; also reachable from the desktop, see "Desktop" below). It
wasn't before: the binary was never built into the ISO, none of its
dependencies (`parted`, `dosfstools`, `e2fsprogs`, `rsync`,
`grub-efi-amd64`, `grub-pc-bin`) were in the package list, so despite
this same README paragraph, there was no way to actually install to
disk from a live session - confirmed missing on a real boot.

First real install hung at "boot from disk" - the installer only ever
put down an EFI bootloader, invisible to BIOS/legacy firmware (which is
what every VM/machine in this whole session has actually been using -
same reason the live ISO needs ISOLINUX at all). Fixed: the partition
table now always includes a `bios_grub` partition alongside the ESP
(GPT+BIOS booting needs one to embed into, there's no MBR-style gap to
reuse), and the installer detects the current firmware
(`/sys/firmware/efi` present or not) and runs the matching
`grub-install --target=i386-pc` or `--target=x86_64-efi` accordingly -
so the same install works on whichever firmware is actually booting it.
Verified locally: the full partition table (including the `bios_grub`
flag) and a real `grub-install --target=i386-pc` against it both
succeed against a loopback device. The rsync + chroot + full boot cycle
still needs a real machine to fully confirm end to end (needs the live
system's own root, not reproducible in a dev sandbox).

## Automated boot test

`.github/workflows/build-devuan-image.yml` has a second job,
`qemu-smoke-test`, that runs after every build: boots the produced ISO
in QEMU and fails the workflow if it doesn't reach a real working
desktop. This exists because a recurring line in this same README used
to be "a VM test never hit this" - several real bugs (dhcpcd vs.
live-boot's network reset, seatd/video-group crashing labwc back to a
shell) only ever surfaced on someone's actual laptop, not because VMs
can't reproduce them, but because nothing was actually driving a VM
boot to completion and inspecting the result.

`scripts/qemu-smoke-test.py` is what does that: a real virtual GPU
(`-vga std`, `-display none` just means QEMU doesn't pop a window on
the CI runner - the guest still gets a real graphics device to drive
via DRM/KMS, same as real hardware) plus a second, independent serial
console (`ttyS0`, autologin, see `0200-agetty-console.chroot`) the
script drives directly - reachable regardless of whatever labwc/seatd
are doing on the "real" tty1/monitor console, so a crash there is
something this script can observe and report instead of a silent
black `-display none` screen. It asserts the same things this project
has always manually checked by hand on real hardware: `/tmp/
tarno-desktop.log` has no `Permission denied` and no `labwc exited`,
`rc-status default` shows `seatd`/`dhcpcd`/`tarno-earlysetup`/`tarnod`
all `started`, `user` is actually in the `video` group,
`/etc/network/interfaces` is still loopback-only, and `labwc`/`waybar`
are both still running processes at the end of boot - not just "did
QEMU exit 0".

Best-effort KVM acceleration (`-accel kvm:tcg`, GitHub-hosted runners
have had `/dev/kvm` since ~2023, just not group-writable by default -
the workflow fixes that the same way the Android-emulator CI action
ecosystem does), falling back to plain software emulation (slower,
still functionally correct - these are boot/config bugs, not
performance-dependent ones) if that doesn't pan out.

Verified locally: the actual command-parsing mechanics
(`run_cmd`/`wait_for_shell` in `qemu-smoke-test.py`) run against a
real pty (`pexpect.spawn("/bin/bash", ...)`, not a mock) - caught and
fixed two real bugs this way before they could produce a silently
wrong CI result: bash's bracketed-paste-mode escape codes breaking the
naive first-line-strip output parsing, and `rc-status default`'s
actual output format (a leading `*` bullet before each service name)
not matching the original regex. The `rc-status`/`tarno-desktop.log`/
`pgrep` assertions themselves checked against realistic sample text
built from this project's own prior real-hardware findings. **Not**
run end-to-end against the real ISO - this sandbox has no `/dev/kvm`,
no `qemu-system-x86_64` installed, and its network policy blocks
`deb.devuan.org` (same class of restriction as `flathub.org`/
`codeberg.org` elsewhere in this README), so an actual `lb build` +
QEMU boot isn't possible here. The next CI run of this workflow is the
first real end-to-end test.

## Updates

Tarno OS ships its own tools as a normal apt repo instead of a custom
updater - `scripts/build-deb.sh` builds `tarno-tools.deb` (tarno-install
+ tarno-disk-install, the install-media tools), `scripts/build-apt-repo.sh`
turns a folder of `.deb`s into a flat apt repo, `.github/workflows/apt-repo.yml`
publishes it to GitHub Pages on every push to `devel`.

Until now that repo only ever carried those two install-media tools -
nothing of the OS itself, so an already-installed Tarno OS system had
no update path at all beyond "reinstall from a new ISO". Fixed:
`scripts/build-os-deb.sh` builds `tarno-os.deb` - literally the whole
OS layer (tarnod, the labwc/waybar desktop, tarno-settings/
tarno-store/tarno-assistant, and all their OpenRC service wiring),
built from the exact same `tarno-devuan-live/config/includes.chroot/`
tree the live ISO ships, so there's one source of truth instead of two
things to keep in sync by hand. Its `postinst` re-runs the same hook
scripts (`tarno-devuan-live/config/hooks/*.chroot`) the ISO build
itself runs - they're already idempotent shell (`rc-update`, `chmod`,
`ln -sf`, `sed -i`), nothing chroot-specific, so they work identically
against a real installed system. Everything under `/etc` it ships is a
`conffile`, so a local edit survives an upgrade instead of getting
silently clobbered.

Deliberately *not* wired into the live/USB image's own `sources.list` -
a live session never persists across a reboot, so it has no use for an
update channel. `tarno-disk-install` writes
`/etc/apt/sources.list.d/tarno-os.list` into the disk-installed system
it produces instead, since that's the system that actually benefits.
The repo is still unsigned - no `APT_REPO_GPG_KEY` secret exists yet -
so this ships as `deb [trusted=yes] ...` for now (a commented-out
signed line sits right above it in the same file, ready to swap in the
moment the secret exists) - a deliberate, user-confirmed interim
tradeoff to make the channel actually work today (transport is already
TLS via GitHub Pages either way) rather than leaving it blocked
indefinitely on a manual step, not something done silently.

Verified locally: `build-deb.sh` + `build-os-deb.sh` +
`build-apt-repo.sh` run together, producing a real two-package repo
(`dpkg-scanpackages` correctly indexes both). `tarno-os.deb`'s contents
inspected with `dpkg-deb -c`/`-e` - correct file tree, ownership,
permissions, `conffiles`, and a working `postinst` (all 6 hook copies
present in the right order, valid shell syntax). The
`tarno-disk-install` apt-source write tested in isolation - correct
path, content, and `0644` permissions, and the resulting one-line
`sources.list` entry parses cleanly with a real `apt-get`. Not run
through an actual `dpkg -i`/`apt install` - no OpenRC/Devuan host in
this sandbox to exercise `rc-update` and friends for real, so the
postinst hasn't been confirmed end to end yet.

## tarnod

The root daemon (this package, `main.go`) listens on a Unix socket
(`/run/tarnod.sock`, JSON in/out) and starts on boot via the OpenRC
service in `tarno-devuan-live/config/includes.chroot/etc/init.d/tarnod`,
enabled by `0450-tarnod-enable.chroot` (the init script alone was never
enough - same gap as agetty/dhcpcd/seatd, confirmed missing on a real
boot). Both the CI workflow and `scripts/build-devuan-live.sh` build it
(along with `tarnoctl` - previously only ever existed as source you'd
have to build yourself, same class of gap `tarno-disk-install` used to
have) and drop them into `config/includes.chroot/usr/bin/` before
`lb build` runs.

    go run . &
    go run ./cmd/tarnoctl status
    MISTRAL_API_KEY=... go run . &          # env var still works...
    go run ./cmd/tarnoctl set-api-key sk-...  # ...or set it live, no restart
    go run ./cmd/tarnoctl ai-status
    go run ./cmd/tarnoctl ai "some question"

The API key can be set two ways now: the `MISTRAL_API_KEY` env var (as
before), or persisted at `/etc/tarnod/mistral_api_key` (`0600`,
root-owned) via the new `set_api_key` socket command - which is what
`tarno-settings`' AI tab and `tarnoctl set-api-key` actually use. tarnod
checks the env var first, falls back to that file on startup, and
`set_api_key` swaps the live provider in immediately (a `sync.RWMutex`
around it) - no restart needed after saving a key from the GUI. Modeled
on (not copied from - it's Python/Windows, this is Go/Linux) how
[`coding-jona/tarno`](https://github.com/coding-jona/tarno) resolves
API keys through a `SecretsVault` instead of reading them raw in
provider code; see `docs/tarno-ai-roadmap.md` for the full comparison
and what's still ahead. Verified locally: a real `tarnod` + `tarnoctl`
round trip (`ai-status` → `not configured`, `set-api-key`, `ai-status`
→ `configured`, and again after a full process restart with no env var
set, confirming the file actually persists it).

The socket is `chmod 0666` right after creation - tarnod runs as root,
so without this it inherits the process umask (typically `0755`), and
Unix-socket `connect()` needs *write* permission, meaning any non-root
client (`tarnoctl`, `tarno-settings`, both run as the live user) got
`EACCES`. Confirmed on a real boot ("tarnod unreachable: [Errno 13]
Permission denied") and fixed locally (verified: a non-root user can
now connect and get a real response). Fine for a single-user image with
root permanently locked - world-writable is the point, not a leftover
mistake.

## Desktop

Minimal Wayland desktop: [labwc](https://labwc.github.io/) (an
Openbox-alike wlroots compositor with a real right-click root menu,
config in `tarno-devuan-live/config/includes.chroot/etc/xdg/labwc/`) +
[waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) as a taskbar (window list via
its `wlr/taskbar` module - needs nothing labwc-specific, just the
`wlr-foreign-toplevel-management` protocol every wlroots compositor
implements - plus a clock and a launcher button for `tarno-settings`;
config in `tarno-devuan-live/config/includes.chroot/etc/xdg/waybar/`) +
`tarno-settings`, a small PySide6 panel
(`tarno-devuan-live/config/includes.chroot/usr/bin/tarno-settings`) that
talks to `tarnod` over its socket - a Status tab, a Network tab (wired
status + WiFi scan/connect/known-networks via `iwctl`, see "WiFi"
below), a System tab (hostname/kernel/uptime/memory/disk, read-only),
an AI tab (Mistral API key setup + a quick ask/answer box to
sanity-check it, see "tarnod" above), an Install tab wrapping
`tarno-disk-install` (also its own "Install to Disk" root-menu entry,
`tarno-install-to-disk` - an interactive terminal wrapper, since the
raw command needs a device name and rsync's progress needs a real tty,
neither of which fits a Qt widget), and a Power tab (reboot/shut
down). Starts automatically on tty1 login
(`/etc/profile.d/tarno-desktop.sh`). Theme is the old
`tarno-ui-theme` palette (cyan `#0BC7FF` on Fluent-style dark gray),
ported to an Openbox `themerc` and a Qt stylesheet - completely different
layout from the old deleted `tarno-desktop`/`tarnod-ui`, same colors.

First real boot test found labwc crashing the login session instantly
(no systemd/elogind means nothing set `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, and that's
labwc's very first startup check - see git history for the fix). Login
now drops into labwc without exec'ing it, so any *other* crash (e.g. no
usable DRM/KMS device on a given machine/VM) lands you back at a shell
instead of bouncing to login. `/etc/profile.d/tarno-desktop.sh` always
logs what happened to `/tmp/tarno-desktop.log` (whether it even ran,
what tty/WAYLAND_DISPLAY/DISPLAY it saw) plus `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/labwc.log`
for labwc's own output - no more guessing blind from a fast-flashing
console.

Second real boot test (with that fix in) found `/tmp` itself not
actually writable - this image's `init=/sbin/openrc-init` setup skips
the usual sysvinit/OpenRC boot chain that normally fixes `/tmp`
permissions (openrc's own `bootmisc`, not wired into this image's
runlevels), so it kept bare `mkdir` permissions. Fixed by a small
dedicated service, `etc/init.d/tarno-earlysetup` (enabled by
`0150-tarno-earlysetup-enable.chroot`), that runs before agetty and
just fixes `/tmp`/`/var/tmp` permissions. `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` also moved
from `/run/user/<uid>` (root:root 0755 - a plain user process can never
mkdir there, confirmed) to `/tmp/runtime-<uid>`, the XDG basedir spec's
own documented fallback for when nothing sets it up properly.

Third real boot test (past both of the above): labwc actually started -
a plain black screen, which turned out to be success, not failure.
labwc, like Openbox on X11, paints no background of its own; without a
wallpaper client the whole output is just black and indistinguishable
from a hung/crashed session. Added `swaybg` (filling with the theme's
base `#202020`) to `etc/xdg/labwc/autostart`, so a working session
actually looks like one.

Fourth real boot test: waybar's taskbar showed every `tarno-settings`
window as "Python (v3.13)". `tarno-settings` runs as `python3
/usr/bin/tarno-settings` (the shebang invokes the interpreter, not a
compiled binary of that name), so without an explicit app_id, Qt's
wayland platform plugin fell back to identifying the window as the
Python interpreter itself. Fixed with `app.setDesktopFileName
("tarno-settings")` plus a matching
`/usr/share/applications/tarno-settings.desktop` (`Name=Tarno
Settings`) so waybar's `wlr/taskbar` resolves it to a real name instead
of the raw app_id.

Core apps: a file manager (`pcmanfm-qt`), a web browser
(`firefox-esr`), a text editor (`geany`), and an app launcher
(`fuzzel`, bound to `Super+Space`, reads `/usr/share/applications/*.desktop`
automatically - no separate config needed to list apps in it) - up to
this point there was nothing to browse files, get online, or edit a
document with at all, just labwc's menu, `tarno-settings`, and a bare
terminal. Also added `wl-clipboard`/`grim`/`slurp` (clipboard and
screenshot CLI tools) - baseline utilities every other wlroots desktop
ships that were simply missing here. Themed `fuzzel.ini` matches the
same palette as everything else.

The waybar "Tarno" button now opens `fuzzel` (a real start menu -
search-as-you-type over every installed app) instead of launching
`tarno-settings` directly; `tarno-settings` is still one search away,
or from the root menu.

`pcmanfm-qt` hit real bugs: "Operation not supported" / "No such file
or directory" doing basic file operations. Root-caused against its own
stock config and dependency list
(`/usr/share/pcmanfm-qt/lxqt/settings.conf`,
`apt-cache show pcmanfm-qt`): it defaults to a terminal and archiver
(`qterminal`, `lxqt-archiver`) that aren't in its own Depends/
Recommends and were never installed here, and defaults to
`UseTrash=true`, which is a known failure class on a live system's
overlay/union root (this image boots via live-boot's overlay over a
read-only squashfs) - GIO's trash implementation can throw exactly
"Operation not supported" there. Fixed via
`etc/skel/.config/pcmanfm-qt/lxqt/settings.conf` (copied into the live
user's home from `/etc/skel` at account creation, not a change to the
package's own file): `Terminal=foot`, `Archiver=xarchiver` (added),
`UseTrash=false` (permanent delete instead, same as most live distros'
file managers default to for this exact reason). Also added
`xdg-user-dirs` + a call to `xdg-user-dirs-update` in
`tarno-desktop.sh` - `~/Desktop`, `~/Downloads` etc. never existed
(nothing in this image was creating them), and pcmanfm-qt's sidebar
bookmarks point at them regardless.

`tarno-store` (`config/includes.chroot/usr/bin/tarno-store`, root menu
+ `/usr/share/applications/tarno-store.desktop`) - a small curated
catalog of ~20 real, well-known apps across categories a usable desktop
needs (Internet, Office, Graphics, Media, Development, System,
Utilities), install/remove with one click via plain `apt-get`
underneath (`QProcess`, streamed output, `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`,
`sudo -n` so it fails fast instead of hanging if that were ever not
passwordless). Not a package-repository browser - `synaptic` (also on
the root menu, `sudo -E synaptic` to keep the Wayland session env
across the privilege jump) is the real thing for that, searching all of
`sources.list`. Same design language as `tarno-settings` - card-style
rows, `Papirus` icons (added explicitly, not left to chance among
pcmanfm-qt's own OR'd icon-theme Recommends), a proper header, refined
color tokens shared between both apps. Verified locally: headless run
(`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`) renders all 20 rows, `is_installed()`
correctly distinguishes installed vs. not (checked against real
`dpkg-query` state), search filtering works.

Second tab, "Flathub" - the curated list is deliberately small (~20
apps), so this is the actual "browse everything" complement: a search
box wired to the real `flatpak search --user
--columns=name,description,application <query>` (tab-separated fields,
confirmed against `flatpak`'s own C source - `flatpak-table-printer.c`
- since the exact format isn't documented anywhere and depends on
whether stdout is a TTY), triggered on Enter/button click rather than
live-filtered as you type since each search is a real subprocess call,
not a filter over data already in memory. Results render as the same
card-row look as the curated tab, Install/Remove driving `flatpak
install/uninstall --user -y --noninteractive` instead of `apt-get`.
`--user` (not `--system`) deliberately avoids needing polkit/root -
this image has no desktop polkit agent, same reasoning as `tarnod`'s
world-writable socket and the NOPASSWD sudoers drop-in. The `flathub`
remote itself is added with `--if-not-exists` from
`tarno-desktop.sh` on every login (per-account, so it can't be done
once at build time the way the apt sources list is) - and since
`flatpak`'s own `/etc/profile.d/flatpak.sh` (shipped by the `flatpak`
package itself) adds `--user`-installed apps' `.desktop` files to
`XDG_DATA_DIRS` automatically, `fuzzel` picks them up with zero extra
plumbing, same as every other app on this image.

Verified locally: the tab-separated parsing logic against sample
`flatpak search`/`flatpak list` output built from the real column
formats in `flatpak`'s own source, headless run instantiates both
tabs without crashing, `flatpak`'s own `/etc/profile.d/flatpak.sh`
inspected directly (installed `flatpak` locally to check) to confirm
the `XDG_DATA_DIRS` wiring. **Not verified**: an actual `flatpak
search`/`install` against the real Flathub remote - this sandbox's
network egress proxy blocks `flathub.org` outright (`403` on
`CONNECT`), so nothing here has run against Flathub's real catalog.
Real on-device confirmation is still needed.

`tarno-assistant` (`config/includes.chroot/usr/bin/tarno-assistant`,
root menu entry "Tarno", `Super+T`) - a real chat window for Tarno OS'
namesake feature instead of the single-line ask/answer box buried in a
settings tab, closer to what Cortana used to be for Windows (minus
voice, deliberately not part of this yet). Talks to the same `tarnod`
socket `tarno-settings`' AI tab does (`ai`/`ai_status`) - API keys are
still only ever configured in Settings, never typed into the chat
itself, matching the same rule the project this is modeled on
([`coding-jona/tarno`](https://github.com/coding-jona/tarno), see
`docs/tarno-ai-roadmap.md`) follows for its own chat surface. Shows a
clear "not configured, go set a key" message and disables the input
instead of silently failing when no key is set yet. Verified locally:
headless run (`QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`) against a real `tarnod`
instance, both states (no key set -> disabled input + guidance message;
key set via a real `set_api_key` call -> "ready", input enabled).

No animations anywhere on purpose - they cost real frame time for zero
functional benefit, especially on the kind of aging hardware this has
actually been tested on. `labwc` has no animation system to begin with
(deliberately effect-free, unlike KWin/Mutter) and neither does
`fuzzel`, so there was nothing to turn off there. `gtk-enable-animations=false`
(`/etc/skel/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini` and the `gtk-4.0` twin, same
`/etc/skel` override mechanism as pcmanfm-qt's `settings.conf`) covers
every GTK3/4 app's menu/tooltip/tab fades - Geany, GTK dialogs, and
`waybar` itself (it's a GTK app under the hood, same setting reaches
its own tooltip fade-in). Firefox's chrome/content animations
(`toolkit.cosmeticAnimations.enabled`, `general.smoothScroll`,
`browser.tabs.animate`, `browser.fullscreen.animate`) are set via a
distribution policy file (`/usr/lib/firefox-esr/distribution/policies.json`,
Mozilla's own binary-relative lookup path, not distro-specific) as
non-locked defaults - the user can still flip them back in
`about:config` if they want, but a fresh install starts snappy. Qt apps
(`tarno-settings`, `tarno-store`) never used any animation API to begin
with, nothing to disable.

`docs/tarno-ai-roadmap.md` lays out where "Tarno" (the AI, not just the
`tarnod` binary) is actually headed - a real system assistant, not just
a Q&A tab - based on a from-scratch architectural survey of
[`coding-jona/tarno`](https://github.com/coding-jona/tarno) (the
namesake project this whole OS is meant to eventually host a version
of): what pattern maps directly onto `tarnod`'s Go/Unix-socket setup,
what's a genuinely separate future phase (tool-use with a real
permission layer, long-term memory), and what's explicitly deferred
(voice, the "Tarno Mesh" multi-device/account system - both by the
user's own choice, not forgotten).

Sixth real boot test (real hardware this time, not a VM - a QEMU boot
had never hit this): black screen, then dropped into a shell in a
rapid respawn loop, `tarno-desktop.sh`'s own log showing
`tty=/dev/console` on every line instead of `/dev/tty1` - so its
`tty[1-6]` check never matched and labwc never even got a chance to
start.
Root-caused via `cat /etc/inittab` and `cat /proc/1/cmdline` on the
actual machine: Devuan's stock `/etc/inittab` still ships its own
`1:2345:respawn:/sbin/getty --noclear 38400 tty1` entry, and
`openrc-init` (confirmed as PID 1) is inittab-compatible and honors
it - completely independent of, and fighting over the same VT with,
the `agetty.tty1` OpenRC service this image adds for autologin. A VM
test apparently never surfaced the race, presumably just different
console/tty wiring under QEMU. Fixed by commenting out just that one
`tty1` inittab line in the same hook that adds `agetty.tty1`
(`0200-agetty-console.chroot`) - `tty2`-`tty6` are left alone, they're
the documented way to get a manual login on another console.

Seventh real boot test: the whole desktop rendered squashed into a
square aspect ratio, on both the live session and a disk-installed
system - not something any config in this image was ever setting
(confirmed: nothing here specifies a resolution/mode anywhere), and
labwc itself has no way to force a specific output mode on its own -
its own manual explicitly says so, pointing at `wlr-randr`/`kanshi`
instead. Whatever labwc's own auto-enable picked on this hardware
wasn't the panel's actual preferred mode. Fixed by reading the mode
`wlr-randr` itself reports as `(preferred)` straight from the
connector and forcing exactly that at the top of
`etc/xdg/labwc/autostart`, before anything else starts - fixes this on
whatever hardware it runs on without hardcoding a resolution number
that would be wrong on different hardware, and is a no-op if the
preferred mode was already active. New `wlr-randr` package dependency.
Verified locally: the parsing logic against realistic sample
`wlr-randr` output (including a case where the active mode differs
from the preferred one - the actual bug class - and a multi-output
case) - correctly extracts and would force the right mode in both.
Not run against real hardware yet.

Eighth real boot test: `dhcpcd` refused to start again ("... defines
some interfaces that will use a DHCP client"), the exact failure class
already fixed once by overriding `etc/network/interfaces` to loopback-
only. `cat /etc/network/interfaces` on the actual booted system showed
the stock `allow-hotplug eth0` / `iface eth0 inet dhcp` content -
confirmed the file baked into the image is still correct (`git show`
against the actual built commit matches the loopback-only source
exactly), so something at *boot time* was overwriting it before
`dhcpcd` ever got to check. live-config's own runtime network
component does exactly this - regenerates a stock DHCP-ready
`interfaces` file on every boot as a "just works" default - and runs
before `openrc-init`/any of this image's own services even start, so
no ordering trick within this image's own runlevels can beat it; it
has to be actively reverted instead. Fixed by having
`tarno-earlysetup` (already the earliest thing this image runs, see
above) force-write it back to loopback-only every boot, right after
fixing `/tmp`'s permissions - same "don't fight the timing, just win
the last word" approach. Verified locally: the exact heredoc logic
in isolation, and that its output does *not* match `dhcpcd`'s own
documented sanity-check pattern (confirmed against the literal grep
expression from `/etc/init.d/dhcpcd`, so `dhcpcd` would actually start
against this content).

Ninth: real hardware repeatedly landed at a plain shell prompt instead
of the desktop, no crash message visible - the actual symptom being
"the OS just drops me into a shell". Root-caused by reading the real
`live-config`, `user-setup`, and `seatd` packages rather than
guessing: `live-config`'s own `0030-user-setup` component explicitly
overrides `user-setup`'s default group list with an *empty* string
(`debconf-set-selections passwd/user-default-groups`) unless a
`live-config.user-default-groups=` kernel cmdline parameter says
otherwise, which nothing in this image sets - so the live `user`
account ends up in zero supplementary groups, not even
`user-setup`'s own (already `video`-less) built-in default. Devuan's
packaged `/etc/init.d/seatd` runs `seatd -g video` (`/etc/default/
seatd`), which makes the seatd socket owned by the `video` group -
without membership, `labwc`'s `libseat` backend can't connect to it
at all, `labwc` exits immediately, and since `tarno-desktop.sh`
deliberately doesn't `exec labwc` (so a crash is visible instead of
silently bouncing back to login), that exit drops straight back into
the interactive login shell - exactly the reported symptom. A
kernel-cmdline fix wouldn't reach a disk-installed system either
(`tarno-disk-install`'s `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` has no
`boot=live`, so `live-config` - and any group list it'd assign -
never runs again there); fixed instead with `usermod -aG video user`
in `tarno-earlysetup`, every boot, same "don't fight the timing, just
win the last word" approach as the two fixups above - this way both
the live USB and anything already installed to disk self-heal on
their next boot. Verified locally: the `usermod -aG video` logic
tested in isolation against a real throwaway user account (starts in
no supplementary groups, ends in exactly `video` after one run,
idempotent on a second run). Not run against a real `seatd`/`labwc`
pair - no such stack in this sandbox to exercise the actual socket
connection end to end.

Tenth: the Eighth and Ninth fixes above both worked by winning a race
every boot - actively reverting whatever a third-party live-boot/
live-config component had just done. Asked to stop patching around
that and remove what's actually getting in the way instead, so both
got fixed at the root:

- The `/etc/network/interfaces` reset isn't `live-config` at all - it's
  `live-boot`'s own `9990-netbase.sh`, which runs from the initramfs
  (before `openrc-init`/anything in this image ever starts) and
  *unconditionally* overwrites the file, confirmed against its actual
  source. It has a documented escape hatch for exactly this: `if
  [ "${STATICIP}" = "frommedia" ] && [ -e "${IFFILE}" ]; then ...
  return; fi` - leave an already-existing file alone. Now set via
  `STATICIP=frommedia` in `auto/config`'s `--bootappend-live`, so
  live-boot never touches the file in the first place.
- The empty-groups bug came from `live-config`'s `0030-user-setup`
  always starting `user` from zero supplementary groups. Its own
  `Config()` already skips itself entirely if the account it wants to
  create already exists (`grep -q "^${LIVE_USERNAME}:" /etc/passwd`) -
  so new hook `0175-user-account.chroot` creates `user` at *build*
  time instead, with the right groups (`video`, `audio`, `cdrom`,
  `dialout`, `plugdev`) from the start, no cmdline flag or
  component-disabling needed, just winning the race by already being
  done before live-config ever checks.

`tarno-earlysetup`'s two reverts from the Eighth/Ninth fixes stay in
place regardless, as zero-cost safety nets in case either escape hatch
ever behaves differently on some Devuan version - but neither should
have anything left to do. Verified locally: `live-boot`'s and
`live-config`'s actual packaged source (`9990-netbase.sh`,
`0030-user-setup`) read directly to confirm both guards exist and
behave as described; the `0175-user-account.chroot` logic (`adduser`
+ `usermod -aG` + `passwd -l`) run in isolation against a real
throwaway account - correct groups, correct locked-password state
(`!` in `/etc/shadow`), idempotent on a second run. Not run through an
actual `lb build` + boot - no OpenRC/live-boot host in this sandbox to
confirm `STATICIP=frommedia` and the build-time account both behave
identically on Devuan's exact packaged versions.

## WiFi

[iwd](https://iwd.wiki.kernel.org/) instead of wpa_supplicant + a
separate tool - one self-contained daemon with its own `iwctl` client,
no `wpa_supplicant.conf` to hand-edit, and it only does L2 association
(dhcpcd still handles DHCP for every interface it finds, wireless
included - same "probes everything" behavior that already covered
wired). Enabled via `0500-iwd-enable.chroot`. Actual chip firmware
(iwlwifi/realtek/atheros/brcm80211, plus a `firmware-misc-nonfree`
catch-all) comes from the `non-free-firmware` archive area, newly
enabled in `auto/config` (Devuan mirrors Debian's post-bookworm
component split - it wasn't enabled before, so none of this firmware
was ever reachable regardless of the package list).

`tarno-settings`' Network tab drives `iwctl` directly: scan, a
double-click-to-connect list (prompts for a password on secured
networks), known-networks with a forget button, and the live wired/
WiFi status. Parses `iwctl`'s human-readable table output the same way
`tarno-store` shells out to `apt-get` - not a stable API, but the only
one that exists without pulling in a D-Bus binding dependency for one
feature. Verified locally as far as the sandbox allows: the parsing
helpers against real sample `iwctl` output, `system_info()`/
`wired_status()` against this sandbox's own `/proc`, `/sys`, `ip` -
**not** run against a real iwd instance or real WiFi hardware (none
available here), so real on-device confirmation is still needed.

## Login

There isn't one - tty1 autologs in as `user` (agetty `--autologin`, see
`tarno-devuan-live/config/hooks/0200-agetty-console.chroot`), same as
every mainstream live image. The account itself is created at *build*
time by `0175-user-account.chroot` (`adduser` + a fixed group list,
locked password - see the Tenth real boot test above for why this
moved off `user-setup`'s own runtime account creation); root is always
locked. Log in as `user` by hand only if you `chvt` to another console.

Passwordless sudo specifically comes from `etc/sudoers.d/tarno-user`
(`user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL`, chmod'd to the `0440` sudo insists on
by `0250-sudoers-perms.chroot` - git can't represent that exact mode on
its own). This README claimed passwordless sudo existed since early in
this project, but nothing ever actually configured it - `sudo` group
membership alone still requires typing your own password. Every place
in this image that shells out with `sudo -n` (non-interactive, so it
fails outright instead of hanging on a password prompt nobody can
answer) was silently failing as a result: `tarno-store`'s Install/
Remove buttons, `tarno-settings`' Power tab (reboot/shut down) and its
Install tab. Confirmed on a real boot (reported as "the Install button
doesn't work" and "can't shut down or restart").

## Status

Wired DHCP needed a fix before it worked at all: Debian/Devuan's
default `/etc/network/interfaces` ships its own `iface ... inet dhcp`
stanza, which made dhcpcd's own init script refuse to start at all
(avoiding a conflict with two DHCP clients on the same interface).
Overridden to loopback-only (`config/includes.chroot/etc/network/interfaces`)
since dhcpcd, not ifupdown, manages every interface in this image.
WiFi is wired up now too, see "WiFi" above. See `ROADMAP.md`.
