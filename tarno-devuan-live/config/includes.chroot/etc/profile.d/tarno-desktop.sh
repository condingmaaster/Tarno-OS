	# var, printing "XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is unset" and exit(1)-ing before
	# doing anything else (confirmed locally: happens in under a
	# millisecond, no delay at all). A bare `exec labwc` here replaced
	# the login shell, so that instant crash just ended the whole
	# session and getty respawned the login prompt - on screen that's
	# indistinguishable from a ~0.1s flash, way too fast to read. Set
	# the var up by hand (the same thing pam_systemd would normally
	# do), force libseat straight at seatd instead of letting it try a
	# (non-existent) logind bus first, and run labwc as a plain child
	# with its output logged - so any *other* crash (e.g. no usable
	# DRM/KMS device) drops back to a shell with a log pointer instead
	# of silently bouncing back to login again.
	# /run/user/<uid> is the "proper" XDG location, but /run itself is
	# (correctly) root:root 0755 - a non-root process can never mkdir
	# under it without a privileged helper (that's what pam_systemd
	# does on a systemd box). Confirmed on a real boot: "Permission
	# denied" trying exactly that. This image has no such helper, so
	# fall back to a per-user directory under /tmp instead - the XDG
	# basedir spec's own documented fallback when no real session
	# manager sets XDG_RUNTIME_DIR up. Requires
	# tarno-earlysetup (etc/init.d/tarno-earlysetup) to have already
	# fixed /tmp's permissions, which it does before this ever runs.
