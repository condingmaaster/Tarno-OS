//! The NT object namespace's `\Device\` + drive-letter view — real name
//! resolution, not the drive-letter-agnostic string strip this replaces.
//!
//! Real NT: `\Device\HarddiskVolume1` etc. are device objects; `\??\C:`
//! (aka `\DosDevices\C:`) is a *symbolic link* in the object manager
//! pointing at one of them — `CreateFileA("C:\...")` resolves the drive
//! letter to its device, then walks the rest of the path on that device.
//! THOS models exactly that indirection, just with a fixed, small table
//! instead of a full dynamic object manager (nothing mounts/unmounts yet):
//!
//! - `\Device\HarddiskVolume1` — the ext2 root, read/write.
//! - `\Device\CdRom0` — the boot ISO's EFI System Partition (FAT32,
//!   read-only) — real content already mounted at boot for the GPT/FAT
//!   milestone (`/EFI/THOS/HELLO.TXT`), not a synthetic second volume
//!   invented just to test this module.
//! - `C:` → `\Device\HarddiskVolume1`, `D:` → `\Device\CdRom0`.
//!
//! An unmapped drive letter, or an unrecognised `\Device\...` name, is now
//! a real failure (`resolve` returns `None`) — before this module existed,
//! *every* drive letter silently aliased the same ext2 root, so `D:\x` and
//! `C:\x` were indistinguishable and a typo'd drive letter just worked by
//! accident.
