//! The Security Service — a real, isolated *userspace* process, not a
//! kernel module. See `docs/thos/roadmap.md`'s security-architecture
//! section: "the scanner never runs in the kernel" is the whole point of
//! this split — a bug in a hash-signature check must not be able to panic
//! ring 0. This is the first slice: real process isolation, a real
//! kernel↔service channel, and one real decision (`check_hash`) actually
//! moved out of the kernel — not the eventual YARA / heuristics / update
//! mechanism, which stays this process's job to grow into.
//!
//! **Channel**: two ordinary pipes (`crate::file::pipe`, the same
//! primitive `pipe()`/`pipe2()` hand out to user processes) — a
//! request pipe (kernel writes, the service reads) and a response pipe
//! (the service writes, the kernel reads). The kernel holds its two ends
//! directly (no fd/task indirection); the service process's fd 0/1 are
//! wired to its two ends by [`crate::process::spawn_with_fds`] instead of
//! the usual console-backed stdio, so nothing it reads or writes is
//! visible to (or forgeable by) any other process.
//!
//! **Protocol**: one request = 32 bytes (a SHA-256 hash); one response =
//! 1 byte (`0` = allow, nonzero = quarantine). Deliberately the smallest
//! real thing that lets the verdict actually live outside the kernel.
//!
//! **Crash safety** ("a crash there degrades to a policy default, it does
//! not take the kernel down" — the roadmap's own requirement): needs no
//! new mechanism at all. `process::set_exit_status` already clears a
//! task's fd table the instant it exits, for any reason (a clean exit or
//! a fault) — so the moment the service process is gone, its end of the
//! response pipe closes, and the kernel's blocking `read` on its own end
//! returns a real `0` (EOF) instead of hanging. [`check_hash`] treats
//! that (or any negative result) as "unavailable" and the caller
//! (`execgate::check`) falls back to its own local, always-available
//! list — the actual policy default.
